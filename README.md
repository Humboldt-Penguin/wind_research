### Hi there! 

Feel free to contact me at [zain.eris.kamal@rutgers.edu](mailto:zain.eris.kamal@rutgers.edu) â€” I'm more than happy to take any questions, criticism, feedback, or discussion. 

- **I also welcome any requests to share/explain code or help adapt it for your purposes.** This repository contains most of my code, but most plots/data are excluded, and modifying this to run elsewhere takes a few steps.

Save this page with [bit.ly/WakesFromSpace](https://bit.ly/WakesFromSpace).

Big thanks to my advisor, [Professor Roger Wang at Rutgers University](https://whirlab.onrender.com/), and Program Manager for the NJ Wind Institute Fellowship at Rutgers, [Chelsie Riche](https://academicaffairs.rutgers.edu/njwind/team).
