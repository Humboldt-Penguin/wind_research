### Hi there! 

Feel free to contact me at [zain.eris.kamal@rutgers.edu](mailto:zain.eris.kamal@rutgers.edu) â€” I'm more than happy to take any questions, criticism, feedback, or discussion. 

- **I also welcome any requests to share/explain code or help adapt it for your purposes.** This repository contains most of my code, but most plots/data are excluded, and modifying this to run elsewhere takes a few steps.
